# StudyBuddy

This project is a **UI/UX design project** completed as part of the course *Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Design*.  

In this project, we designed **StudyBuddy**, a tablet-optimized application aimed at helping students improve their study process and prepare for exams more effectively.
The app contains an **AI-powered personal assistant** to provide smart and efficient study tailored to each student.
The goal was to create an intuitive user experience with a visually appealing interface that meets the specific needs of a student user.
